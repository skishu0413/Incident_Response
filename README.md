# 🛡️ Incident Response Projects

Welcome to the **Incident Response** portfolio repository. This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity investigation and incident response projects developed as part of hands-on academic and professional training.

Each project simulates a real-world scenario—ranging from phishing and malware infections to intrusion detection and forensic log analysis—using modern tools and techniques such as **Splunk**, **Suricata**, and **network forensics**.
