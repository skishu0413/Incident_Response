# 🔐 Incident Response Investigation – Electric Lumber

## 🏢 Company Background

**Electric Lumber** is a Managed Service Provider (MSP) formed after the reorganization of the **North American Lumber Coalition (NALC)**, a global leader in sustainable lumber harvesting and processing. Following a significant breach in 2017, NALC transitioned its IT operations to Electric Lumber. Now, Electric Lumber manages IT services, websites, and HR systems for NALC and another regional lumber company, **Timberr**.

## 🧑‍💻 Scenario

Electric Lumber's cybersecurity team has received a critical alert from a customer of **NALC**, claiming that the **NALC website** infected their computer. You are part of the **incident response team** tasked with investigating this potential website compromise.

Your objectives:
- Analyze logs and evidence released over time
- Investigate the root cause of the reported infection
- Execute a complete incident response cycle
- Document findings, actions, and recommendations

> ❗ Note: Electric Lumber has no system or data backups and **no cyber insurance**. Incident response must be thorough and internally executed.
